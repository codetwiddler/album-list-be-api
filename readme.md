# Simple Album List Application Back-end in .NET Core using C#

This project was bootstrapped from VS2022's Web API solution templates (the classic 'weather reporting' API) and expanded into a set of projects which align with a CQRS pattern. It leverages an in-memory database and seed data for demonstration purposes.

Upon execution it should load up in your default browser to the address `https://localhost:7286/swagger/index.html` whereupon the Swagger/OpenAPI info will be available for review.

Should work in VS2022 targeting .NET Core 6
